# Sprint-Review-Retrospective
## CS-250 Final Project: Sprint Review and Retrospective

### Reflection
**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**  
I’ve learned to use user stories and acceptance criteria to translate user needs into clear, actionable tasks. Focusing on “who, what, and why” helps ensure every feature ties directly back to the user’s goals.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
I approach development iteratively, breaking large goals into smaller deliverables. I plan to continue using Scrum principles like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives to stay adaptable and improve continuously.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
It means communicating openly, being accountable for your work, and supporting others when obstacles arise. Collaboration and transparency help teams deliver consistent value.
